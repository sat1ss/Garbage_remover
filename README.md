# Garbage_remover
This script will:

1. Delete files from folders with unnecessary files.

Configuration info:

1. Selected folders:
	- C:\Windows\Temp
	- C:\Users\{Current_user}\AppData\Local\Temp
	- C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download

I would recomend using Task Scheduler to automate it even more.
